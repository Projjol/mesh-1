Where Idea came from
I moved to new area recently in the same city(Mumbai). One of the problem me and my family facing was finding local vendor/store for things like household items, grocery, home services etc. Google wouldn't return much answers when it comes to small stores like dairy, general stores and home services. Ordering online won't work when you need any item immediately, espacially in developing countries like India where people not much active online expect messenger services like Facebook Messenger, Telegram etc. For any small businesses/stores it is difficult to build their own platform where they can receive orders online, discover clients easily or receive/send payments. Bot platform can be answer to those questions and With advantage of DigitalTown platform, Using its SSO and Wallet API it will be very simple to solve those problems. 

How it can impact society
User acquisition is very fast when it comes to bot platform. It will move trend towards local businesses when it comes to Online experience, also it's completely free to use and open sourced, which will shift power from big cos like Amazon, Uber, Airbnb and other similar giants to local vendors. This will every city self contained and its win-win for all.

How I built it
I wrote down all the major features, user flows, ideas I had in my mind.


Challenges I ran into
Data modelling was quite complicated. Setting up bot, webhooks took much of my time. Also Desiging architecture which supports multiple bot platforms

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being able to implement features/ideas I had

What I learned
This is by far best project I have worked on. It involved web server, bot apis and talking to Digitaltown's services. I implemented SSO for the first time so that was major area where I learned alot

What's next
NLP can be the next step. Bots should be able to understand in natural language while onboarding or while talking to users (Most of flows are call-to-action based). Feature are very basic, I would say what I have implemented is 0.01% of what it can be so theres alot of work to do :)
